# keylogger1
This is python based project to capture key stroke of devices.


KEYLOGGER Project

I developed a python code which will simply run in the command prompt and it will send the key logging information through the email address I provide. Basically we will get to know for which purpose our system is being used by someone else. A keylogger or keystroke logger/keyboard capturing is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control (C&C) server. The hacker then analyzes the keystrokes to locate usernames and passwords and uses them to hack into otherwise secure systems.
